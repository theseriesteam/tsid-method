# Theseries DID Specification


## Introduction
DID provides a unique identification to protect the privacy of the sovereign identity for Theseries System


## Status Of this document
This is a draft document

## Target System
The target system is the Ethereum network where out contract is deployed. This could either be:

    Mainnet
    Sepolia
    other EVM-compliant blockchains such as private chains, side-chains, or consortium chains.

An example contract has been deployed to Sepolia testnet `0x47e6334374a7453B5fB22e37838E7B1d1e856BC4` for test purpose. 


## DID Method Definition
DID is the decentralization of userâ€™s digital identity, whose format is as follows:
```
did:theseries:<method-specific-id>
```
Method-specific-id is the blockchain address genderated by the public key hash,  the key pair is generated by DID SDK using HD wallet accounts.

example:
```
did:theseries:0xedc76A675c4e0e793a3Af2C307FB8dA09bFe3D11
did:theseries:mainnet:0xedc76A675c4e0e793a3Af2C307FB8dA09bFe3D11
did:theseries:sepolia:0xedc76A675c4e0e793a3Af2C307FB8dA09bFe3D11
```
Supports Ethereum "mainnet" and "sepolia" currently, can be extended in the future.


Algorithm support for key generation:
- Secp256k1
- more algorithms in the future

## DID Document Definition

Minimal DID Document example
```
{
  "@context":[
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
    "https://w3id.org/security/suites/secp256k1recovery-2020/v2"
  ],
  "id": "did:theseries:0xedc76A675c4e0e793a3Af2C307FB8dA09bFe3D11",
  "verificationMethod":[{
    "id": "did:theseries:0xedc76A675c4e0e793a3Af2C307FB8dA09bFe3D11",
    "controller": "did:theseries:0xedc76A675c4e0e793a3Af2C307FB8dA09bFe3D11",
    "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1RecoveryMethod2020",
    "blockchainAccountId":"eip155:1:0xedc76A675c4e0e793a3Af2C307FB8dA09bFe3D11"
  }],
  "authentication": [
    "did:theseries:0xedc76A675c4e0e793a3Af2C307FB8dA09bFe3D11#controller",
  ]
}
```


## Operations

![simple flow](images/tsid-erc725-seq.svg)



### Creation
As users already have HD wallet accounts, just make use of them.
use first address of first account as method-specific-id.
e.g.
```solidity
function createID() public returns (address did) {}
```
calling createID() should create an ERC725 based smart contract and return contract address.
(TBD: ERC1056)

### Read (Resolve)
Client should cache ERC725 contract address.
```solidity
function getData(bytes32 dataKey) public view returns (bytes memory dataValue) {}
```
Call contract.getData() to fetch data of a given did to make DID Document.

for any reason client loses cached contract address invoke resolveID() to regain.
```
function resolveID(address owner) public view returns (address did) {}
```

### Update
Call contract.setData() to update DID data.
```solidity
function setData(dataKey, dataValue) public onlyOwner {}
```


### Delete(Revoke)
Owner can call revoke() to revoke DID.
```solidity
function revoke() public onlyOwner {}
```
Should update all data to empty and set owner to address 0x0.


## Privacy and Security considerations
### Privacy Considerations

In theseries system, all users' private data is stored in local area. Only hash values or strings generated by crypt algorithms of the data are public on-chain, the attackers cannot derive the private data with the hash value or strings.

All data stored in DID documents is considered public. DID documents do not contain any personal information about the user concerned.


### Security considerations

DID document is signed using the users private key, any modification to the document requires a new signature.

User should manage private key (and mnemonic, passward of the wallet) locally and never expose to the public. losing these private key means losing control of DID and all
VCs.
